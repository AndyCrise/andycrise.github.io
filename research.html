    <h2>Coherent Phonon Dynamics in solids</h2>

    <p>A femtosecond laser pulse can initiate <strong>collective, in-phase</strong> atomic motions in solids called
        <strong>Coherent Phonons</strong>.
        Because of the pulse width, it can always pick two photons in one pulse to generate one phonon and the coherence
        of the photons will transfer to the phonons, thus we can generate coherent phonons. We can use pump probe
        experiment to capture the phonon dynamics, where the pump is for excitation and probe is sensitive to the
        refractive index change due to the modulation in the mean displacement as well as mean square displacement of
        the atomic positions. Either reflection or transmission change will be recorded. The generation and detection of
        coherent phonons provide an opportunity to understand the fundamental physics between light and matter
        interaction, as well as a path to manipulate other physical processes, for applications such as sound
        amplification stimulated emission (SASER), phonon mode manipulation, ultrafast phase switching,
        superconductivity enhancement and manipulation of magnetism.

    <h2>Nanoscale energy transfer revealed with ultrafast spectroscopy</h2>

    <p>To understand and ultimately control the properties of most functional materials, from molecular soft-matter to
        quantum materials, requires access to the structure, coupling, and dynamics on the elementary time and length
        scales that define the microscopic interactions in these materials, such as electron-electron coupling,
        electron-phonon coupling, as well as phonon-phonon scattering. Ultrafast spectroscopy is a great tool to gain
        access to these goals. </p>


    <h2>Wave phenomena at the nanoscale (topological acoustics)</h2>

    <p>Acoustic phonons represent a versatile platform for the study of wave dynamics for their short wavelengths (few
        nanometers at 100 GHz-THz frequencies) comparable to the recent length scale in nanotechnology. Just like the
        protected gapless surface state in the topological insulator, topological acoustic interface state was proposed
        in optomechanical cavities, which should be particularly robust. </p>

    <h2>On-chip coherent information control (Brillouin scattering, optomechanical cavities)</h2>

    <p>Rapid progress in integrated photonics has fostered numerous chip-scale sensing, computing and signal processing
        technologies. GHz-acoustic phonons have the advantages storing information, filtering, and delaying at smaller
        length-scales with high fidelity. The study of mechanical systems in their quantum ground state motivates the
        development of novel optomechanical resonators with frequencies higher than a few GHz. In this particular
        frequency range, standard cryogenic techniques become sufficient to reach the quantum regime without relying on
        additional sideband optical cooling.

    <h2>Carrier dynamics (electron-electron, electron-phonon, phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, moir√© pattern) </h2>

    <p> 2D devices provide rich physics in quantum regime. Ultrafast spectroscopy is a great tool to reveal quantum
        phenomena at spatio-temporal level. </p>
